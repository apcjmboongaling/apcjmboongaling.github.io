	I currently am a 2nd year college student at Asia Pacific College,<br>
	and I want to graduate as early as possible to help my family.<br>
	I am not good in Mathematics and programming, but I want to learn.<br>
	I am struggling in programming, but I feel happy when my codes work,<br>
	I feel like I did a lot of things when my small codes work. During this course,<br>
	I want to learn more about programming.<br>
	I am familiar with computer hardware, like installing devices,<br>
	swapping out computer parts and basic installation of programs.

	<p><strong>Did you choose this course? Yes/No, Why yes?</strong><br>
	Yes, I chose this course because I am the quite techy guy and I want to deepen my understanding of technology,<br>
	I don’t have any past programming experiences and I just learned few programming techniques when I entered college,<br>
	I am quite struggling but it’s fun when my codes work I feel satisfied.<br>
	Also, there are lots of opportunities in the Technological world that’s why I chose this course, to help my family.</p>
	
	<p><strong>If no, what course woud you choose?</strong><br>
	I was thinking of taking Civil Engineering if I didn’t take IT for my course in college since most of my cousins are engineers.</p>
	
	<p><strong>I.T. Experience: Programming / Gaming / Other</strong><br>
	I currently still struggling with programming, I love playing computer games and mobile games,<br>
	I was also a computer shop caretaker before, I tried to fix small problems on my aunt’s computer shop before like installing games,<br>
	swapping out RAM, swapping out monitors, power supplies and other hardware issues,<br>
	the only thing that I didn’t do is to program a computer but I know basic installation of games and updates.</p>

	<p><strong>Goals in life / Pangarap sa buhay</strong><br>
	<p>I want to help my mother and sister, My sister is currently our breadwinner and I am the only guy since I don’t have a father,<br>
	I want to give back to my sister when I graduate since she sacrificed a lot for me and my mother,<br>
	my mother suffered from stroke 3 years ago and my sister stopped going to school just to work for us.<br>
	If I graduate, I’ll tell my sister to resign so that I can take over and let her focus on her academics,<br>
	she is also currently in 2nd year college while working for us.<br>
	If I graduate earlier than her my first goal is to send her to school so that she can focus on her dreams.<br>
	I also want to have our own home since we are just renting our home right now.</p>
	
	<p><strong>What do you expect to learn from this course?</strong><br>
	I have said earlier that I am familiar with hardware of a computer but not with programming,<br>
	I want to learn more since It is quite hard for me to cope up with other programming subjects.<br>
	I mostly rely on Online videos if I don’t understand my lesson.<br>
	I expect to learn many from this course in a more understandable manner.<br>
	I currently don’t have any experience in web programming that’s why I want to learn many from this course.</p>
